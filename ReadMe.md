This is a simple project for creating frames from a given 1-D signal. This project is solely for signal processing using python.Generating frames from a signal requires framelength and step size or overlap size. In the main function, I also demonstrated an example to see how it works. This project is helpful for all who need to generate frames for signal frequently.

Project requirement - python 2.7, numpy.
